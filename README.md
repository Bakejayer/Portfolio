In this project we were tasked with creating a 12 and 24 hour clock to display on the command line,
along with a menu with functions to change to displayed time. In this project, I think I did a particlularly
good job of separtating my code into functions in accordance with OOP principles, as well as commenting 
my code to make it easy to understand how everything works. This program could be enhanced with different 
constructors which would allow it to be implemented in different ways. I could also alter some functions 
to make them static and usable without implementing a Clock object.

This was a fairly easy project to complete. The most trouble I had was when working with a struct that came with 
Java's time library, but looking through the documentation was enough to get around this. This program was made 
readable and adaptable by adhering to clean code and OOP principles throughout. The code is well commented and
each function does as little as possible, and with small tweaks this could easily be used in other applications.
